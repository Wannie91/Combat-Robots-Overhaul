    "description": "This mod aims to overhaul Factorio's combat robots to make them more useful. Destroyer Robots now automatically destroy discovered biter nests. Defender Robots will either follow the player or defend the base in case of an attack. (Toggle-able by shortcut). Distractor robots have been renamed to Sentry Units to better describe their purpose. They act as cheap semi-mobile turrets."
