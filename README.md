# Combat Robots Overhaul
This mod overhauls Factorio's vanilla Combat Robots to make them more useful and to automate the fight against biters.

Destroyer Units will automatically attack every biter nest that has been discovered either by the player or by radar.

Defender Units will either follow and defend their player, or defend the base in case of an attack. (Toggleable)

Distractor Units have been renamed to Sentry Units and are used as mobile turrets. They patrol the area where they have been thrown at.

For balancing purposes, the recipes have been changed so that only one unit is spawned per capsule. Once thrown, they can't be reclaimed anymore but in return have an unlimited lifespan. Furthermore, the maximum combat robot number per player counts for each group seperately.

To make the combat robots more accessible in the early game, all types are unlocked after researching combat robotics 1.

Since I'm not sure yet about these balances, please let me what I can change to make them more balanced.
