# Combat Robots Overhaul
This mod overhauls Factorio's vanilla Combat Robots to make them more useful against biters. 

Destroyer Units will automatically attack every biter nests (and worm) that have been discovered either by the player or by radar.

Defender Units will either follow the player, or automatically defend the base in case of an enemy attack. (Behaviour controlled by Toggleable shortcut)

Distractor Units have been renamed to Sentry Units and have more or less keept their old behaviour. They patroul the area where they have been thrown at and act as cheap mobile turrets.

For balancing purposes, the recipes of the combat robots have been changed so that only one unit is spawned per capsule. Once thrown, the robots can't be reclaimed anymore. In return, they have a unlimited lifespan and can be repaired. 

Furthermore, each group is limited to the players maximum combat robot following count seperatedly. To make the technology more accessible in the game, all the robots recipes are unlocked after researching combat robotics 1. Their recipes has also changed. 

However, since I'm not sure yet about these balances, please let me what you thinkg or what I can change to make them more balanced.
