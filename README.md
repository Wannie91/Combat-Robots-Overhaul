# Combat Robots Overhaul

## Version
0.1.1

## Description
This mod overhauls Factorio's vanilla combat robots to make them more useful by automating the fight against biters. 

Destroyer Units will automatically attack every biter nest (and worms) that has been discovered by radar or by the player. 

Defender Units will either follow the player, or automatically defend the base in case of a biter attack. (Toggleable)

Distractor Units have been renamed to Sentry units to better describe their purpose. They partrol a small area where they have been thrown at and act as cheap mobile turrets. 

For balancing purposes, the recipes of combat robots have been changed. While the overhauled combat robots are cheaper than the vanilla ones, each capsule only spawns one of them. In return, the robots have a unlimited lifespan and can be repaired. The sentry unit can furthermore be mined to get the unit back. 

To make the combat robots more accessible in the early game, each type is unlocked after researching the first tier of combat robotics. Each unit type is also limited seperatedly by the overall maximum robot follower count. 

Please let me know if you think the mod needs more balance.
