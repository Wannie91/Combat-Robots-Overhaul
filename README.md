# Combat Robots Overhaul

## Version
2.1.11

## Description
This mod aims to overhaul the behaviour of Factorio's vanilla combat robots to make them more useful by automatically attacking enemies. 

Defender Units will either follow the player or automatically defend the base in case of a biter attack. (toggle-able)

Distractor Units have been renamed to Sentry Units to better describe their purpose. They patrol a small area (configurable) and act as cheap mobile turrets. 

Destroyer Units automatically attack biter nests (and worms) which have been discovered by radar and or player.

For balancing purposes the recipes of the robots have been changed. While the overhauled combat robots are cheaper than the vanilla ones, each capsule only spawns one of them. In return, the robots have slightly increased health, can be repaired and have a unlimited lifespan. Futhermore, the sentry unit can be mined to get the unit back. 

To make the combat robots more accessible in the early game, all of them are unlocked after researching the first tier of combat-robotics. Each unit type is also limited seperatedly by the maximum robot follower count.
