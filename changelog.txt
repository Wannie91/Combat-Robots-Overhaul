Version: 2.1.9
Date: 02.01.2023
  Compatibility:
    - Fixed an issue with space exploration which caused the game to crash when landing a spaceship. Unfortunatly, due to the workings of space exploration, all combat robots will be removed upon landing. 
  Interfaces:
    - Added a interface which returns the targetList. To get the list, use e.g. remote.call("combat-robot-overhaul", "get_targetList", surface_index = 1). Surface_index can be omitted to get the list for all surfaces.
